Rabies is a viral disease that causes encephalitis in humans and other mammals.[1] It was historically referred to as hydrophobia ("fear of water") because its victims panic when offered liquids to drink. Early symptoms can include fever and abnormal sensations at the site of exposure.[1] These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness.[1][7][8][9] Once symptoms appear, the result is virtually always death.[1] The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months but can vary from less than one week to more than one year.[1] The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system.[10]

Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses, including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus.[4] It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animals.[1] Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose.[1] Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved.[1] In countries where dogs commonly have the disease, more than 99% of rabies cases in humans are the direct result of dog bites.[11] In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs.[1][11] Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies.[11] The disease can be diagnosed only after the start of symptoms.[1]

Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world.[1] Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those at high risk, including those who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common.[1] In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms.[1] Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone-iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission.[1][12] As of 2016, only fourteen people were documented to have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms.[13][14] However, research conducted in 2010 among a population of people in Peru with a self-reported history of one or more bites from vampire bats (commonly infected with rabies), found that out of 73 individuals reporting previous bat bites, seven people had rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (rVNA).[15] Since only one member of this group reported prior vaccination for rabies, the findings of the research suggest previously undocumented cases of infection and viral replication followed by an abortive infection. This could indicate that people may have an exposure to the virus without treatment and develop natural antibodies as a result.

Rabies causes about 59,000 deaths worldwide per year,[6] about 40% of which are in children under the age of 15.[16] More than 95% of human deaths from rabies occur in Africa and Asia.[1] Rabies is present in more than 150 countries and on all continents but Antarctica.[1] More than 3 billion people live in regions of the world where rabies occurs.[1] A number of countries, including Australia and Japan, as well as much of Western Europe, do not have rabies among dogs.[17][18] Many Pacific islands do not have rabies at all.[18] It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.[19]

The global cost of rabies is estimated to be around US$8.6 billion per year including lost lives and livelihoods, medical care and associated costs, as well as uncalculated psychological trauma.[20]

Rabies causes about 59,000 deaths worldwide per year,[6] about 40% of which are in children under the age of 15.[16] More than 95% of human deaths from rabies occur in Africa and Asia.[1] Rabies is present in more than 150 countries and on all continents but Antarctica.[1] More than 3 billion people live in regions of the world where rabies occurs.[1] A number of countries, including Australia and Japan, as well as much of Western Europe, do not have rabies among dogs.[17][18] Many Pacific islands do not have rabies at all.[18] It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.[19]

The global cost of rabies is estimated to be around US$8.6 billion per year including lost lives and livelihoods, medical care and associated costs, as well as uncalculated psychological trauma.[20]

Rabies is a viral disease that causes encephalitis in humans and other mammals.[1] It was historically referred to as hydrophobia ("fear of water") because its victims panic when offered liquids to drink. Early symptoms can include fever and abnormal sensations at the site of exposure.[1] These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness.[1][7][8][9] Once symptoms appear, the result is virtually always death.[1] The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months but can vary from less than one week to more than one year.[1] The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system.[10]

Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses, including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus.[4] It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animals.[1] Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose.[1] Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved.[1] In countries where dogs commonly have the disease, more than 99% of rabies cases in humans are the direct result of dog bites.[11] In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs.[1][11] Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies.[11] The disease can be diagnosed only after the start of symptoms.[1]

This article provides a comprehensive review of the causes, symptoms, transmission, and management strategies of the common cold. \n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe common cold, as its name suggests, is one of the most prevalent illnesses in humans. It is estimated that adults experience an average of 2-3 colds annually, while children can have as many as six to eight. The common cold is responsible for approximately 40% of time taken off work and even more time off school. \n\nPathophysiology and Causes:\n\nThe common cold is primarily caused by several types of viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most prevalent. Other viruses such as coronaviruses, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and respiratory syncytial viruses can also cause cold symptoms. These viruses invade the body through the respiratory tract, often entering through the nose and mouth. \n\nSymptoms and Diagnosis:\n\nThe onset of a cold is usually marked by a sore throat, followed by symptoms such as a runny nose, congestion, cough, and mild headache. Fever is relatively uncommon in adults but can occur in children. The symptoms usually peak within two to three days and resolve within seven to ten days. The diagnosis of a common cold is typically based on the symptoms and clinical examination, and laboratory tests are generally not necessary.\n\nTransmission:\n\nThe common cold spreads through virus-laden droplets that are expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can be inhaled, or they can land on surfaces that are touched by others, who then touch their own nose or mouth. Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands, can also spread the virus.\n\nPrevention and Management:\n\nThere is no cure for the common cold, and treatment primarily involves symptom relief. Over-the-counter cold remedies can help alleviate symptoms like a runny nose, congestion, and body aches. Rest and hydration are also critical for recovery. Preventive measures include regular handwashing, avoiding close contact with infected individuals, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to boost the immune system.\n\nConclusion:\n\nDespite being a common affliction, the impact of the common cold on societal health and productivity is substantial. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and transmission of the common cold can help in implementing effective strategies for prevention and management, thereby reducing the global burden of this ubiquitous illness.\n\nKeywords: Common cold, Viral rhinosinusitis, Rhinovirus, Symptoms, Transmission, Prevention, Management.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
